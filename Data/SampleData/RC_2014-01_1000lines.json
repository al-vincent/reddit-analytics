You empty and rinse it every 12 hours and then reinsert, and sterilize it in boiling water at the end of every cycle. Unlike a pad or a tampon, it can be reused for multiple cycles - some companies boast their cups will last 10 years.\n\n[Diva Cup](http://divacup.com/) is probably the most popular / common brand, but I prefer [MeLuna](http://www.meluna.ca/) because they offer the great variety of sizes and grip styles.\n\nEdit: Just realized in linking to the MeLuna site that the FDA has changed regulations regarding menstrual cups and they can't ship to the US until they get approved.

Understand that if they currently are fighting and they don't live together, this won't improve when they have to share space. \n\nDesignate one room as the Chow's room and the other for the Shar Pei.

After an hour, put that dog back in his room, and get the other dog. \n\nDon't be fooled for one minute that all of a sudden thru some magical nonsense or other that they will love each other. That's how people wind up in the ER with the plastic surgeon getting lots of stitches. \n\n\nOnce you guys are living together, and you take them for walks on neutral ground, you can see if they still, no matter what, are aggressive towards each other. If they are, understand that that won't change, especially if you can not afford a trainer. If they seem to be more or less ok with each other, you can gradually increase time together in the house, but **not** when there is food around. \n\nThe reason why I am so cautious is that dogs tend to learn from fights with their housemates. They learn to hate each other more, so you really don't' want it to get to that stage. \n\nThe reason for the crate in a room is in case you have that clueless friend who wanders in and wants to let Fluffy out to chill with Muffy.

(Example: reddit policy did not substantially change before/after its own ES.) Thus ES cannot possibly mean what you think it to mean, to \"denigrate democratically-produced content\"\u2014the two are totally orthogonal concerns (they don't imply the other).\n\n**Objectively**, Eternal September is just a social phenomenon. Any thoughtful person would realize there are both desirable and undesirable aspects to website/forum scaling. In particular, and you conveniently gloss over this point, it is important to understand that  *lowest-common-denominator*-produced content is not the same as *democratically*-produced content\u2014that's the moral of the story of Eternal September. Does that make sense so far? So, while ES is sometimes used *by* some smart but elitist redditors, there is nevertheless an underlying reality for what's going on. The phenomenon is what matters for analysis.\n\n**More generally**, content quality is always evaluated separate from the content system, not the other way around. In your sloppy reasoning you have conflated the two without  *justification*. \n\n**Even though you claim familiarity, you didn't raise nor acknowledge any of these 3 basic issues. I did. See the difference? I'm just saying, maybe you should think on this a little, before continuing to claim there's something wrong with what I've said and continue to say.**","author_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhov","name":"t1_ceeft2i","created_utc":"1388534413","controversiality":0}

Everyone figures out what they want to make in dollars first and then back figures what that is in bitcoins. Over the one year period when bitcoin went from $10 to $1000, did merchants keep their BTC/goat prices the same? Because I'm guessing the USD/goat price stayed much flatter.\n\n&gt; Bitcoin doesn't need fiat currency to exist.\n\nIt most certainly does. At least at this point in time and for the foreseeable future it does.\n\n&gt; The euro can be priced in terms of dollars too, but that doesn't mean it's backed by dollars.\n\nBecause inside the eurozone they don't use dollars to buy and sell things, and for the most part they don't care what the current exchange rate is. Fluctuations between those currencies directly impact some areas like imports/exports/tourism, but those take a while to adjust and don't immediately impact the rest of the economy. With bitcoins everyone immediately adjusts their prices for everything to match dollars every second. Imagine the equivalent, a european supermarket where prices were really based in dollars and their prices in euros changed every second based on what the euro was currently trading at. Now imagine every single aspect of the entire eurozone being immediately tied to and converted back to the dollar, then yes, I'd say the euro was backed by the dollar.\n\nAs I said before, the only reason these stores exist is because they can currently get their bitcoins out into some fiat currency. So in that case, yes, bitcoins are backed by fiat currencies. If Euros couldn't be exchanged for dollars, people inside the eurozone wouldn't immediately stop using euros.\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"ceeft4n","distinguished":null,"score_hidden":false,"created_utc":"1388534419","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s3qj","name":"t1_ceeft4n"}

Until earlier this year I did not speak of what had happened to me. It took me almost 12 years to speak of it. Now the people closest to me know but it was extremely hard to tell them. Once I told them and realized that they are still behind me and love me lifted a huge weight off of my shoulders. \nThe guy that unexpectedly came into my life earlier this year flipped my world upside down. Until him I accepted that I was going to be single my whole life (I also had vaginismus to the point that I could not even use a tampon) and I was fine with that. Once my ex came in I got the courage to face my past and change my future. \nI have accepted what had happened in my past but I do worry how future SO's will take it. I dont think they will see me as dirty but as broken... does that make sense?? Although I have accepted what has happened I want it to be my past, I do not want it to influence any part of my life anymore. I fear that I will be looked at as broken, not strong, fragile, someone that a person has to tip toe around. Which to me is weird because I like being submissive in bed.... it doesn't make sense to me and that is another reason where I feel that they cannot be connected. I don't want to be viewed as fragile but I want a loss of control. \nMy life changed so fast and dramatically this year I haven't really had time to process it all I guess. Now that the guy that changed everything for me and was with me every step of the way is not with me anymore I really don't know how or what to say to future boyfriends. Not long after we broke up I purposely went and had a one nightstand to prove to myself that I could. Im sorry I am rambling on.... not sure if any of this stuff makes any sense or if it is even relevant. I guess when I posted all of this I was hoping for agreement and validation that what happened to me is in my past and no longer has any affect on me. Not sure where I go from here. \nI am so sorry all that had happened to you... I cant even imagine. If you don't mind me asking how long ago was that?

It looked pretty, sounded nice, and seemed to have solid mechanics, but it really fell apart as soon as you started playing it.  Block training made sense, but didn't work, part of the point of the early games was slow unit progression, it didn't want to just be another starcraft or total annihilation with huge armies and a bunch of explosions, it wanted to be something in which the conflict took place on a smaller scale and economy actually mattered quite a bit.  Much more defined civilizations seemed smart, but really just made it extremely difficult to balance, and difficult to balance often leads to poor balance, as shown in this game.  The city system looked to be a neat way to get more resources when the finite ones ran out, but ended up artificially gimping new players, and rewarding combat excessively.  The cannons were neat, but were kind of pointless, the only ones actually useful were mortars since they actually could fuck up buildings effectively.  Relying on different attack types for different purposes, instead of making everything based on resists and strengths seems to be smart but was bad too, ranged shouldn't have a viable way to defend itself at close combat, that is the whole point!","id":"ceeftc1","distinguished":null}

Out with Jim right now.\" That way I can go back to Reddit.\n\nDon't expect them to constantly be available though. Set up hangout dates. Remember, if they are actually busy, then let them be. Don't pester them, they will see you as clingy. That will make things worse.Let them know you are available to hang out. When they want to as well, they will let you know.\n\nI suggest finding someone who is truthful with you.

Ideologies can spread without violence, but when they're spread by war resources are always a primary objective. The South's war to demand state's rights were specifically about maintaining slaves; the North fought to maintain its territory and resources. Nazis had their Lebensraum. Every camp that has gone to war to spread their ideology/religion has done it to gain resources.\n\nEven religious wars are also primarily about resources, both directly and indirectly. The crusades themselves were about claiming [holy] land in the name of Christendom. Religious wars are also about affecting the marketplace of ideas by force. If I kill or forcibly convert all Sunnis there are more Christians or more room for Christians to expand. You only have to look at all the medieval Gothic cathedrals to see that religion was a lucrative business for those getting tithes &amp; handing out indulgences.\n\n&gt;not much about acquiring resources\n\nWars usually have an aggressor and a defender. In this instance the War on Terror is supposed to be a defensive war against extremists to maintain the status quo, or to defend interests/assets/resources already held.
